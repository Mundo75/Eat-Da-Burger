# Eat-Da-Burger :hamburger: :beer:

This is a Full Stack application written using Node JS, HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, and express, express-handlebars, mySQL, body-parser, ORM packages, in a MVC model (Models, Views, Controllers).

In this simple App, by typing into the input form field at the bottom of the page, the user can add any burger to a holding div, and then has the option to leave it there on the menu or devour it. The data is appended to a SQL table that I created at the beginning of the project as instructed by the instructions. If the user chooses to devour any of the burgers in the holding div, by clicking the "Devour!" button the status of the burger is changed in SQL database and the burger is moved to the right side on browser screen where devoured burgers are shown in a different holding div.
